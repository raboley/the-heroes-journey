# The Heroes Journey

[![PDD status](http://www.0pdd.com/svg?name=raboley/the-heroes-journey)](http://www.0pdd.com/p?name=raboley/the-heroes-journey)

The hero will go through a journey to take drab README.mds into a new world allowing for flexibility and a new level of embedding for code. He will bring these learnings back to his home making all this documentation clear and executable.

this will include:

* Embedding the contents of code files into documentation ([embedme](https://github.com/zakhenry/embedme))
* Enabling tab controls to allow for multiple versions of code to be contained in one set of documentation ([slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax))
* Embed diagramming into documentation as a living diagram not an image ([lucidChart + Github](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/integrations/github))
* Automatically create issues using puzzle development ([pdd](http://www.0pdd.com))
* ?generate diagrams for infrastructure from terraform code ([cloudCraft](https://medium.com/faun/modules-tf-convert-visual-aws-diagram-into-terraform-configurations-e61fb0574b10))
* Execute examples in documentation to test for accuracy ([dredd](https://rollout.io/blog/testing-code-examples-in-documentation/)) ([official](https://dredd.org/en/latest/))

* Objective: Clear and up to date documentation
* Obstacle: lots of developers and languages as part of their team
* Outcome: Documentation automation makes all developers become documenters and Reid ends up becoming a developer

## ACT 1

### 1. The Ordinary World

Reid is a technical writer at a medium sized hat company.
He is on a team with a couple developers and a manager.
He is in charge of writing all the documentation for the features that the developers create for their hat pricing service.
He doesn't have much experience writing code, but understands source control well enough to update READMEs in his team's repos and can write markdown.
He enjoys his job and has a reasonable workload that allows him to keep his job a 9-5.
He has good relationships with all the developers and knows enough about their API to translate their features into clear understandable documentation.

2. The Call of Adventure

@todo #51:15mins write the Call to adventure chapter

Reids hat company is so successful that they are bought out by an apparel company who prides themselves on being a software comany.
All their code is open source, and so shortly after the aquisition the hat pricing api goes opensource. Now Reid and his team have potential issues and features created by other internal teams, or external teams who use their api. 
Others realize they can use the hat API to price just about any type of product and has integrations built in for all the major shippers.
Reids team isn't setup for 

Reid's company continues to grow and they expand into selling t-shirts.
They hire some new developers and a new manager to create the new T-shirt team, but are unable to find a technical writer to handle documentation for the team.
The new manager works with his current manager to "promote" Reid to lead technical writer and begin writing documentation for both the hat and T-Shirt team.
Reid is young and eager to prove himself so he accepts for a very small raise.

Things start out okay and he is able to keep up with the hat team's steady predictable new features, while trying to understand the initial design and ideas around the T-Shirt teams beginnings. Soon the T-Shirt team starts to finish out initial designs and starts creating features for Reid to document. 
He eagarly starts writing out documentation for their first feature after talking with t-shirt team developers.
Soon he finds himself in meetings with all the different developers from each team all day, and all the actual technical writing he does happens after he gets home.
He feels exhilerated and has a great sense of pride in his work, because he feels very important.
He knows that without him there won't be any documentation done for their projects making him an essential part of the process.
Months go by and that feeling of exhiliration and pride begins to fade as he works 10-12 hours days balancing priority of changes for both teams and documenting those changes.
He begins to feel like something has to change.
He asks his manager to hire another technical writer, but his manager says it just isn't in the budget anymore, but they are so thrilled with the work he has been doing.



One of the developers, Ruby said that developers could try to document their own changes, but the manager refused.

* Weeks go by and developers make tons of changes that Reid has to keep up to date as their technical writer. He can't keep up and a developer complains that a set of instructions is out of date and documentation is unclear.

3. Refusal of the Call

* Reid refuses to make windows instructions because he thinks that it makes his documentation too complicated, and he doesn't have time for it.

4. Meeting the Mentor

* Enter Ruby who drove documentation pratices at big g corp, a worldwide organization that is known for highly skilled engineers. She fixes some problem he was working on that would take a day, in like 10 minutes so he has time.

One day a woman named Ruby entered README's office. Ruby had a red romper that seemed to move as wind brushed against her sides. She looked at the documents README produced and looked perplexed.
She brings him a stone slate.

5. Crossing the First Threshold

* He talks about the problem the developer brought to him that he needed a better way to show different types of documentation so users of his tools can get working right away. She shows him slate, and he enters the new world of web based documentation.

Looking at the slate he can see an entire world inside it.

// maybe he comes across the slate as he is doing documentation as an example?

On the stone slate there are words etched into it face.

```shell
make serve-docs
```

README runs his fingers across the words and in the crevices light begins to erupt and cause the tablet to shift into the symbols:
