# The Heroes Journey

[![PDD status](http://www.0pdd.com/svg?name=raboley/the-heroes-journey)](http://www.0pdd.com/p?name=raboley/the-heroes-journey)

The hero will go through a journey to take drab README.mds into a new world allowing for flexibility and a new level of embedding for code. He will bring these learnings back to his home making all this documentation clear and executable.

this will include:

* Embedding the contents of code files into documentation ([embedme](https://github.com/zakhenry/embedme))
* Enabling tab controls to allow for multiple versions of code to be contained in one set of documentation ([slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax))
* Embed diagramming into documentation as a living diagram not an image ([lucidChart + Github](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/integrations/github))
* Automatically create issues using puzzle development ([pdd](http://www.0pdd.com))
* ?generate diagrams for infrastructure from terraform code ([cloudCraft](https://medium.com/faun/modules-tf-convert-visual-aws-diagram-into-terraform-configurations-e61fb0574b10))
* Execute examples in documentation to test for accuracy ([dredd](https://rollout.io/blog/testing-code-examples-in-documentation/)) ([official](https://dredd.org/en/latest/))

* Objective: Clear and up to date documentation
* Obstacle: lots of developers and languages as part of their team
* Outcome: Documentation automation makes all developers become documenters and Reid ends up becoming a developer

## ACT 1

Reid is a technical writer for a software company who knows how to make README documentation.
One day a developer rewrote all the shell scripts associated with Reids documentation into powershell and asks Reid to update all his documentation to include those scripts for windows users which could look really great as a website.
He says his README documentation is enough and has all the information need once he puts in both versions, then you just have to look for it, and he doesn't have time to learn how to make it into a website.
Another developer, Ruby, is hired at Reids company and she shows him how to use embedme to update all the script blocks in documentation to include powershell as well and automatically, which makes including the new scripts much easier using the command `make embedme` to simplify this task.
With all Reids new free time she shows him slate, something she worked on at her last company, which prompts him to [click the link](https://raboley.github.io/the-heroes-journey/) and enter a whole new world.























## ACT 1

### 1. The Ordinary World

Reid is a technical writer at a medium sized hat company.
He is on a team with a couple developers and a manager.
He is in charge of writing all the documentation for the features that the developers create for their hat pricing service.
He doesn't have much experience writing code, but understands source control well enough to update READMEs in his team's repos and can write markdown.
He enjoys his job and has a reasonable workload that allows him to keep his job a 9-5.
He has good relationships with all the developers and knows enough about their API to translate their features into clear understandable documentation.

2. The Call of Adventure

Reid's company continues to grow and they expand into selling t-shirts.
They hire some new developers and a new manager to create the new T-shirt team, but are unable to find a technical writer to handle documentation for the team.
The new manager works with his current manager to "promote" Reid to lead technical writer and begin writing documentation for both the hat and T-Shirt team.
Reid is young and eager to prove himself so he accepts for a very small raise.

Things start out okay and he is able to keep up with the hat team's steady predictable new features, while trying to understand the initial design and ideas around the T-Shirt teams beginnings. Soon the T-Shirt team starts to finish out initial designs and starts creating features for Reid to document. 
He eagarly starts writing out documentation for their first feature after talking with t-shirt team developers.
Soon he finds himself in meetings with all the different developers from each team all day, and all the actual technical writing he does happens after he gets home.
He feels exhilerated and has a great sense of pride in his work, because he feels very important.
He knows that without him there won't be any documentation done for their projects making him an essential part of the process.
Months go by and that feeling of exhiliration and pride begins to fade as he works 10-12 hours days balancing priority of changes for both teams and documenting those changes.
He begins to feel like something has to change.
He asks his manager to hire another technical writer, but his manager says it just isn't in the budget anymore, but they are so thrilled with the work he has been doing.

3. Refusal of the Call

One day a new developer comes onboard to the t-shirt team who is only used to windows, while the rest of the team uses macs. 
Reid had created very clear instructions on how to make their development tools, and application start up for macs, but didn't ever write anything for how to do it on windows.
After a while the new developer gets it to work, and the manager asks Reid to make instructions for windows.
Reid says he doesn't have time to make those instructions, and he would have to put it in a whole new place in the documentation since he can't have both windows and mac commands in the same place in their README without it looking really messy.
One of the new developers Ruby, asks Reid to consider moving some of their documentation out of a README and into a more web based format.
She says that they can be a lot more flexible and make things much cleaner if they have more control over it like a fully web based site would give them.

4. Meeting the Mentor

* Enter Ruby who drove documentation pratices at big g corp, a worldwide organization that is known for highly skilled engineers. She fixes some problem he was working on that would take a day, in like 10 minutes so he has time.

One day a woman named Ruby entered README's office. Ruby had a red romper that seemed to move as wind brushed against her sides. She looked at the documents README produced and looked perplexed.
She brings him a stone slate.

5. Crossing the First Threshold

* He talks about the problem the developer brought to him that he needed a better way to show different types of documentation so users of his tools can get working right away. She shows him slate, and he enters the new world of web based documentation.

Looking at the slate he can see an entire world inside it.

// maybe he comes across the slate as he is doing documentation as an example?

On the stone slate there are words etched into it face.

```shell
make serve-docs
```

README runs his fingers across the words and in the crevices light begins to erupt and cause the tablet to shift into the symbols:

[http://192.168.0.49:4567](http://192.168.0.49:4567)
