# The Heroes Journey

## ACT 1

1. The Ordinary World

In the beginning there was only text. Documentation was akin to only what could be produced using notepad. The humble README lived to serve with his only tool of raw text.
He produced documentation in flat text form for developers around the world to read and everything was good.

2. The Call of Adventure

As time went on applications became more complex, and README began etching more and more text describing these systems. Soon developers around the world got tired of the flat documents README produced and wanted something more dynamic and easier to understand.

3. Refusal of the Call


4. Meeting the Mentor

One day a woman named Ruby entered README's office. Ruby had a red romper that seemed to move as wind brushed against her sides. She looked at the documents README produced and looked perplexed.
She brings him a stone slate.

5. Crossing the First Threshold

Looking at the slate he can see an entire world inside it.

// maybe he comes across the slate as he is doing documentation as an example?

On the stone slate there are words etched into it face.

```shell
bundle exec middleman server
```

README runs his fingers across the words and in the crevices light begins to erupt and cause the tablet to shift into the symbols:

[http://192.168.0.49:4567](http://192.168.0.49:4567)

## ACT 2

6. Tests, Allies, Enemies

Time and Help enter as enemies to README, time causing his documentation to become out of date due to Help adding features and not updating documentation.

Coming across embedme he found that the steps written as scripts could now be embedded into his documents automatically. simply by runing `npx embedme ./source/index.html.md` he was able to pull the contents from his scripts and embed them in the file automatically allowing for every step to be captured in a way that requires setup steps to work.

He later found make who helped him even further strengthen his resolve. By using `make docs` he was able to run all the steps required to generate the documentation in a way that was repeatable. Now if only this step could also be run automatically when Help added new features.
