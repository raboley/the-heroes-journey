# The Heroes Journey

## ACT 1

1. The Ordinary World

In the beginning there was only text. Documentation was akin to only what could be produced using notepad. The humble README lived to serve with his only tool of raw text.
He produced documentation in flat text form for developers around the world to read and everything was good.
