# The Heroes Journey

[![PDD status](http://www.0pdd.com/svg?name=raboley/the-heroes-journey)](http://www.0pdd.com/p?name=raboley/the-heroes-journey)

The hero will go through a journey to take drab README.mds into a new world allowing for flexibility and a new level of embedding for code. He will bring these learnings back to his home making all this documentation clear and executable.

this will include:

* Embedding the contents of code files into documentation ([embedme](https://github.com/zakhenry/embedme))
* Enabling tab controls to allow for multiple versions of code to be contained in one set of documentation ([slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax))
* Embed diagramming into documentation as a living diagram not an image ([lucidChart + Github](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/integrations/github))
* Automatically create issues using puzzle development ([pdd](http://www.0pdd.com))
* ?generate diagrams for infrastructure from terraform code ([cloudCraft](https://medium.com/faun/modules-tf-convert-visual-aws-diagram-into-terraform-configurations-e61fb0574b10))
* Execute examples in documentation to test for accuracy ([dredd](https://rollout.io/blog/testing-code-examples-in-documentation/)) ([official](https://dredd.org/en/latest/))

* Objective: Clear and up to date documentation
* Obstacle: lots of developers and languages as part of their team
* Outcome: Documentation automation makes all developers become documenters and Reid ends up becoming a developer

## ACT 1

### 1. The Ordinary World

Reid is a technical writer at a medium sized hat company. He is on a team with a couple developers, testers and a manager. He is in charge of writing all the documentation for the features that the developers create for their hat pricing service. He doesn't have much experience writing code, but understands source control well enough to update READMEs in his team's repos and can write markdown. He enjoys his job and has a reasonable workload that allows him to keep a 9-5 and leave it all at work when he goes home.

2. The Call of Adventure

@todo #51:15mins write the Call to adventure chapter

* Weeks go by and developers make tons of changes that Reid has to keep up to date as their technical writer. He can't keep up and a developer complains that a set of instructions is out of date and documentation is unclear.

As time went on applications became more complex, and README began etching more and more text describing these systems. Soon developers around the world got tired of the flat documents README produced and wanted something more dynamic and easier to understand.

3. Refusal of the Call

* Reid refuses to make windows instructions because he thinks that it makes his documentation too complicated, and he doesn't have time for it.

4. Meeting the Mentor

* Enter Ruby who drove documentation pratices at big g corp, a worldwide organization that is known for highly skilled engineers. She fixes some problem he was working on that would take a day, in like 10 minutes so he has time.

One day a woman named Ruby entered README's office. Ruby had a red romper that seemed to move as wind brushed against her sides. She looked at the documents README produced and looked perplexed.
She brings him a stone slate.

5. Crossing the First Threshold

* He talks about the problem the developer brought to him that he needed a better way to show different types of documentation so users of his tools can get working right away. She shows him slate, and he enters the new world of web based documentation.

Looking at the slate he can see an entire world inside it.

// maybe he comes across the slate as he is doing documentation as an example?

On the stone slate there are words etched into it face.

```shell
make serve-docs
```

README runs his fingers across the words and in the crevices light begins to erupt and cause the tablet to shift into the symbols:
